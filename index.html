                    In July 2024, a baby hippo was born in a Thai zoo and instantly won the love of the public, The
                    Pattaya News
                    reported. The publication notes that families with children visiting the zoo are eager to see and
                    photograph
                    the adorable pygmy hippo. This is the seventh baby born to a pair of parents, Jonah and Tony, at
                    Khao Kheow
                    Open Zoo.

                    The baby has been named Nong Mu Deng and his photos continue to grace the internet. More recently,
                    this rare
                    species of pygmy hippo has also joined the ranks of zoo residents in the Czech Republic. The
                    popularity of
                    the baby is so great that even simple things with his image gain millions of views on social
                    networks.

                    Zoo officials have stated that Nong Mu Deng is growing quickly and has already shown a playful
                    personality,
                    delighting visitors with his antics. Conservationists emphasize the importance of such births, as
                    pygmy hippos
                    are listed as endangered due to habitat loss and poaching.
